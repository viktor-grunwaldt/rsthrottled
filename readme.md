# rsthrottled (name pending)

personal rewrite of [https://github.com/erpalma/throttled](https://github.com/erpalma/throttled).
Should have feature parity with the original, except I'm targeting specifically NixOS on ThinkPad t480.

## why?

Original was written in python, and hogs 31 MiB all the time. Also I wanna learn Rust.

## install?

no idea!
